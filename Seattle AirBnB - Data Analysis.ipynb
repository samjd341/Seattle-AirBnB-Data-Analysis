    "AirBnB hosts face a competitive market, against other AirBnB hosts, and more traditional temporary accomomodations such as hotels, when holiday makers are choosing where they are going to stay. One major factor in competition between AirBnB hosts is the ratings they have been given by previous guests. Achieving a higher rating should help to increase the number of bookings they receive. In this analysis, we attempt to unpick the reasons why AirBnB rentals achieve a higher rating. "
